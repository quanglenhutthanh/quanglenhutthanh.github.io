# About Udacity 

https://www.udacity.com/

Udacity is an online learning platform that offers both free and paid courses. Udacity students build their knowledge and skills in subjects like programming, product design, data science, product management and software development.

Udacity helps learners round out their resumes and even begin new careers in business and technology. If you want to change careers or sharpen your skills, Udacity’s courses or Nanodegrees may be the right fit for you.

## Nanodegree

A Nanodegree comprises three to four single courses, which learners complete over a recommended number of weeks. The program culminates with a project that allows students to demonstrate their mastery of a subject. Nanodegree programs serve all levels of learners, from beginner to advanced. Advanced courses require prerequisite knowledge and skill in a subject.

## Is Udacity recognized by employers?

Udacity’s courses and Nanodegrees are not accredited and cannot be transferred to educational institutions. However, course completion certificates and capstone projects still hold value among employers. You can use a completion certificate or capstone project to bolster your resume or job-ready portfolio.
