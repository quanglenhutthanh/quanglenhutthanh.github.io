![Flask](img/flask.png)

Flask is a popular web framework for Python that allows developers to create web applications quickly and easily. Flask is based on the Werkzeug toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine, which provide a flexible and powerful foundation for building web applications. Flask also supports extensions that can add functionality such as database integration, authentication, testing, and more. Flask is designed to be lightweight and modular, so developers can choose the components they need for their project. Flask is also known for its simplicity and elegance, as it follows the principle of "one way to do it" and avoids unnecessary complexity.
