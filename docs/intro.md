# How I create this page

I've chosen **Docusaurus** to build my website specifically for documentation purposes. Docusaurus is an open-source tool tailored for creating and managing documentation websites. Its user-friendly interface allows for swift and straightforward site creation. You can easily and quickly set up your site by following the instructions outlined here: https://docusaurus.io/docs.

I use **GitHub Pages** to host my site, which can be found at https://pages.github.com/. It is a free static site hosting service.

I also employ **CI/CD** through **GitHub Actions** to enable automatic deployment and build processes. This involves creating a GitHub repository to store the source code of my site, and setting up a GitHub Action that automates the build and deployment whenever I push new code to the repository, you can refer [here.](https://jamesiv.es/blog/github/actions/2022/01/23/deploying-to-github-pages-with-github-actions?fbclid=IwAR1ZuG8lXjF32VS7SDV24eRoqoYeBlPtOuF_cPzDpRc1X1dhgOks5WmF91k)
