# Hi there!


I am **Quang**. I live in Vietnam. I am a software developer with 8 years experience. I working on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central | Dynamics NAV Technical Consultant.

Currently, I am diving into the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This new endeavor is part of my continuous journey towards personal growth and self-improvement. I believe that writing is a powerful tool to refine my thinking and analytical skills.

This site isn’t just about showcasing my expertise; it’s a personal journey. It’s a place where I can document my learning, experiences, thoughts, and evolving perspectives on life. 

It’s a tool for personal growth and self-improvement. Writing, I believe, is a powerful way to refine thinking and analytical skills, and I invite you to join me on this intellectual adventure.
