# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/business-central/overview/

**Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** (formerly known as **Microsoft NAV** and before that, it was **Navision**) is an Enterprise Resource Planing solution for managing all business processes, and part of Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 range of business applications. It gives a single, end-to end solution for managing finances, operations, sales and customer service, and an opportunity to easily upgrade from entry-level accounting software and legacy [ERP systems](https://www.the365people.com/enterprise-resource-planning).

## Customization

Dynamics 365 Business Central offers a high degree of customization through its programming language. Users can tailor the platform to fit their specific business needs by adding or modifying fields, creating custom applications, workflows, and reports. This flexibility enables businesses to adapt the software to match their unique processes and requirements without extensive coding knowledge.

## Hosting

1. **Cloud**: Microsoft hosts Business Central in the cloud (Software as a Service - SaaS), providing easy access, automatic updates, scalability, and reduced infrastructure costs.
2. **On-Premises**: Some businesses prefer hosting Business Central on their own servers, allowing them to have more control over data and customization. This requires managing the infrastructure and updates internally.
