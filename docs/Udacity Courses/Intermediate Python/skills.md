# Nanodegree Skills

**Advanced Python Techniques**

1. **File I/O:** Python provides functions to interact with files on the filesystem, allowing reading from and writing to files.
2. **Functional Programming Concepts:** Concepts like higher-order functions, lambda functions, map, filter, and reduce are part of functional programming paradigms in Python.
3. **Python Data Structures:** Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets,â€¦
4. **Object-Oriented Python:** Python supports object-oriented programming, allowing the creation of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
5. **Python Exception Handling:** Using try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions, ensuring smoother program execution.
6. **Python Data Types:** Integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and more are the basic data types in Python.
7. **Code Debugging:** Identifying and fixing errors or bugs in the code to ensure its proper functionality.
8. **Magic Methods:** Special methods in Python denoted by double underscores, like \_\_init\_\_ or \_\_str\_\_, allowing customization of class behavior.
9. **Python Namespaces:** Mechanisms that Python uses to ensure that names in a program are unique and can be used without any conflicts.
10. **Python Classes:** Blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating data, and methods that operate on that data.
11. **JSON:** JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format, commonly used for data storage and transmission.
12. **Pythonic Design Patterns:** Efficient and commonly used ways of solving particular problems or organizing code in Python.
13. **Python Function Definition:** Defining functions to perform specific tasks or operations within a program.
14. **Python Best Practices:** Adhering to established conventions and patterns that make code more readable, maintainable, and efficient.
15. **Python Decorator Functions:** Functions that modify other functions or methods.
16. **Object-Oriented Design Patterns:** Patterns used in object-oriented design to solve common problems encountered when designing software.
17. **Object Creation Design Patterns:** Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, hiding and encapsulating the object creation logic

**Large Python Codebases with Libraries**

1. **Web Services:** Building and consuming web services to enable communication between different systems over the internet.
2. **Application Servers:** Deploying and managing applications on servers to serve web content or provide services.
3. **Flask (Web Framework):** Using Flask, a lightweight web framework, for developing web applications with simplicity and flexibility.
4. **Application Routing:** Defining URL routes to direct incoming requests to specific functions or views in a web application.
5. **Python Package Management:** Managing Python packages and their dependencies specifically for web application development.
6. **Application Dependency Management:** Handling and managing dependencies required for the proper functioning of web applications.
7. **Scripting for Web Applications:** Employing Python scripts to automate tasks, handle web-related operations, or interact with web services in web applications.
8. **Fetching Data:** Retrieving data from various sources (databases, APIs, files) for processing or analysis in web applications.
9. **API Fluency:** Proficiency in working with APIs, understanding how to make requests, handle responses, and integrate external services into web applications.
10. **REST APIs:** Understanding and implementing RESTful APIs, a common architectural style for networked applications, in web development using Python.
