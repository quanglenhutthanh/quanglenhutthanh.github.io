## Introduction to Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy
- **Data Analysis Process**
Learn about the data analysis process and the Python packages used in this course.

- **Jupyter Notebooks**
Jupyter Notebooks are a great tool for sharing insights and visualizations alongside your code.

- **Exploring and Inspecting Data**
Use the pandas library to load data, view its properties, and start asking data analysis questions

- **Manipulating Data using Pandas and NumPy**
Use the pandas library to perform data cleaning, filtering, and reshaping tasks.

- **Communicating Results**
Draw conclusions and communicate results to stakeholders by calculating statistics and creating basic data visualizations with the pandas library

## Advanced Data Wrangling
- **Gathering**
You will learn to implement data gathering methods to obtain and extract data from various sources and in several popular data formats.

- **Assessing**
You will learn to identify different data quality and structural issues and apply visual and programmatic assessments to catch them.

- **Cleaning**
You will learn to remediate the issues you identified in the assessment stage and test that your data cleaning is successful.

## Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Design of Visualizations**
Learn about elements of visualization design, especially to avoid those elements that can cause a visualization to fail.

- **Univariate Exploration of Data**
In this lesson, you will see how you can use Matplotlib and Seaborn to produce informative visualizations of single variables.

- **Bivariate Exploration of Data**
In this lesson, build up from your understanding of individual variables and learn how to use matplotlib and seaborn to look at relationships between two variables.

- **Multivariate Exploration of Data**
In this lesson, see how you can use Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize relationships and interactions between three or more variables.

- **Explanatory Visualizations**
Previous lessons covered how you could use visualizations to learn about your data. In this lesson, see how to polish up those plots to convey your findings to others!
